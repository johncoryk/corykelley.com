				<p>
					Hey, I’m Lee. I'm a developer, writer, and the creator of Mastering
					Next.js and React 2025. I work at ▲Vercel as a Solutions Architect.
					I’ve spoken across the country at conferences and meet-ups about
					front-end development, design, and recruiting. I write about
					development, tech careers, and my personal life on my newsletter. I
					grew up in small-town Iowa and went to school at Iowa State,
					graduating with a degree in Computer Engineering. I spend my free time
					playing music, creating videos, and enjoying time with friends and
					family in Des Moines, IA.
